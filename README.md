This project involves designing and developing a relational database system for managing large volumes of data generated by a film festival organization. The system aims to address challenges related to data organization, scalability, and accessibility by providing a structured and efficient data storage solution that supports the festival’s operational needs, including film submissions, scheduling, ticketing, and attendee management.
