This project involves designing and developing a relational database system for managing large volumes of data generated by a film festival organization. The system aims to address challenges related to data organization, scalability, and accessibility by providing a structured and efficient data storage solution that supports the festival’s operational needs, including film submissions, scheduling, ticketing, and attendee management.

- The data_implementation file will create tables and add data into the tables.
- The sqlScript file contains some of the queries/stored procedures/triggers which can be use to control and manage data operations in the database. This ensure the data consistency and support transactional operations within the database system.
